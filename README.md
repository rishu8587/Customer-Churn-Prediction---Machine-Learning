# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction – Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting **customer churn** using machine learning
classification techniques. Customer churn refers to customers who stop using
a company’s services. The objective of this project is to identify patterns and
factors that influence churn so businesses can take proactive retention actions.

The project follows a complete **end-to-end machine learning workflow**, starting
from data exploration and preprocessing to model training and evaluation.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
- Handle categorical and numerical features
- Build and evaluate machine learning models
- Identify key factors affecting customer churn
- Compare model performance using evaluation metrics

## 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used
- Python
- Pandas, NumPy
- Matplotlib, Seaborn
- Scikit-learn

## 📂 Dataset
The dataset contains customer information such as:
- Demographics
- Service usage
- Contract type
- Monthly and total charges
- Churn status (target variable)

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis
- Analyzed churn distribution
- Studied relationship between churn and features like:
  - Contract type
  - Tenure
  - Monthly charges
- Visualized correlations and patterns affecting churn

## 🤖 Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- Random Forest Classifier

## 📊 Model Evaluation
The models were evaluated using:
- Accuracy score
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision, Recall, and F1-score

### 🔑 Key Findings
- Customers with month-to-month contracts have a higher churn rate
- Higher monthly charges increase churn probability
- Long-term customers are less likely to churn
- Random Forest performed better than Logistic Regression

## ✅ Conclusion
This project demonstrates practical application of **machine learning
classification** techniques in a real-world business problem. It highlights the
ability to analyze data, build predictive models, evaluate performance, and
draw meaningful business insights. The project is suitable for **Data Analyst /
Data Scientist fresher roles**.
